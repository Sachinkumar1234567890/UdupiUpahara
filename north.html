        <div class="inner">The earliest appearance of "naan" in English is from 1803 in a travelogue of William Tooke.[5] The Persian word nān 'bread' is attested in Middle Persian as n'n 'bread, food', which is of Iranian origin, and is a cognate with Parthian ngn, Kurdish nan, Balochi nagan, Sogdian nγn-, and Pashto nəγan 'bread'.[6] Naan may have derived from bread baked on hot pebbles in ancient Persia.[7]

The form naan has a widespread distribution, having been borrowed in a range of languages spoken in the Indian subcontinent and also Central Asia where it usually refers to a kind of flatbread (tandyr nan).[7] The spelling naan has been recorded as being first attested in 1979,[8] but dates back at least to 1975,[9] and has since become the normal English spelling. Many English speakers refer to it as "naan bread" which is a common mistake, as simply "naan" already means "bread".[10]
Naan (Persian: نان, romanized: nān, Urdu: نان, Kurdish: نان, Pashto: ډوډی, Uyghur: نان, Hindi: नान, Bengali: নান) is a leavened, oven-baked (usually using a tandoor) or tawa-fried flatbread,[1] which is found in the cuisines mainly of Iran, Afghanistan, Central Asia, the Indian subcontinent, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, and the Caribbean.[2][3][4]

        <div class="inner">Chole bhature is a food dish popular in the Northern areas of the Indian subcontinent.[1] It is a combination of chana masala (spicy white chickpeas) and bhatura/puri, a deep-fried bread made from maida.[2][3][4]

            Chole bhature is often eaten as a breakfast dish, sometimes accompanied with lassi. It can also be street food or a complete meal and may be accompanied with onions, pickled carrots, green chutney or achaar.
            There is debate over the place of origin for chole bhature. Some sources claim the dish to have originated in Delhi, where it is very popular.[6][7] Others claim eastern Uttar Pradesh to be the place of origin.
            Chole is prepared by cooking chickpeas and adding spices such as cumin, coriander seeds, turmeric powder, and chili powder. Onion, garlic, and ginger are also added for additional flavor. Bhature is prepared by combining flour, salt, and oil, and kneading the dough. The dough is rolled out into circles and deep-fried until the bhature puff up.
